**DBMS (Database Management System)** is software that stores and manages data. It acts as a **referee**, **mediator**, or **manager** between the user and the database storage.

- **Model**: Data is stored following specific rules (data models).
- **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **Security & Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity and handles concurrent access.
- **Abstraction**: Hides hardware/storage complexity from users and developers.

### Popular DBMS Examples

- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQL Server
- IBM DB2

Each DBMS does similar work but with different features and implementations.

> ðŸ’¡ **Analogy**: DBMS is the chef, data is the dish, SQL is the order.  
> Different chefs cook differently, but all deliver the same meal.
