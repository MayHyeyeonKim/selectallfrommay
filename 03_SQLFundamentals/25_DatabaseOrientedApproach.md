# Database Oriented Approach

## 1. Limitations of File Processing Systems

- Data was stored in separate files, causing redundancy and inconsistency.

- There was no built-in way to relate data between systems.

- sers and developers had to understand how data was stored and managed.

- Custom software had to be written for every use case, which was inefficient and costly.

## 2. Rise of the Database Approach

- With the rise of Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL, systems shifted to using DBMSs.

- Databases followed a common structure (data model) that enforced consistency.

- Users no longer had to know how or where data was stored.

- Different systems could now communicate using the same structure.

## 3. What is a DBMS?

- A DBMS (Database Management System) is software that manages data storage and access.

- It enforces a data model that defines relationships between different data sets.

- The database approach unified scattered and redundant data into a consistent, centralized system.

## 4. Role of SQL

- SQL (Structured Query Language) became the standard for communicating with DBMSs.

- With SQL, developers didnâ€™t need to know the details of the underlying storage or system.

- It enabled simpler, more powerful, and more consistent data access across platforms.
